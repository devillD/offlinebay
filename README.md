OfflineBay by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/techtac">TechTac</a>
</h1>

Stable version: [**`2.0.0`**](https://github.com/techtacoriginal/offlinebay/releases/tag/2.0.0)

OfflineBay is a free and open-source tool created to hold and parse copies of torrent archive dumps. So it allows you to search and download torrents offline. OfflineBay can parse CSV files with many torrenting related added features. The parsing is programmed to match the structure of dump files created by The Pirate Bay. But any group or organization can follow that same structure to create dump files to be used with OfflineBay.

# Downloads

OfflineBay is distributed as a portable application in favor of the majority. Download the corresponding package and extract the **ZIP** file. All of the packages should have an executable (double-clickable) along with some other files. File named `OfflineBay.exe` or `OfflineBay.app` or `OfflineBay` would be the executable file.

**NOTE:** Linux users may need to declare the file as an executable before running - `chmod +x OfflineBay`

**Why downloads are larger than the previous version?**<br>
Well, OfflineBay 2 is created using [Electron](https://electronjs.org) and NodeJS. So the disk footprint could be a [little concerning](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/2003).  There is no way around this issue. This is one small compromise for a lot of improvements.

**WARNING:** Since OfflineBay is now open-source you could stumble upon some modified versions of OfflineBay. If you get infected with malware by going off the proper channels, i won't take any blame for them.

If you're looking for the older version of OfflineBay, Downloads are available [here](https://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Release-OfflineBay-1-0-2-Download-torrents-from-thePirateBay-offline).

**How to remove OfflineBay?** <br>
I personally believe that none of the applications should leave any residue in the removal process. Unlike other portable apps OfflineBay will not leave anything behind once you hit delete on the application folder. It's valid for all platforms. Everything will be removed including Dump files, configurations and error logs.

# Build OfflineBay yourself

You will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Usually packed with NodeJS) installed on your computer to build OfflineBay yourself.

**NOTE:** When creating OfflineBay i almost managed to completely avoid native modules. But there's a single module named `bufferutil` that's required by another module. You may run into a few errors when building if you don't have platform build tools for `node-gyp`. You can simply ignore those errors since the module is an optional dependency. Also since OfflineBay practically has no native dependencies, it's possible to cross-build without any complications. But i cannot guarantee on the outcome.

Clone this repository, `cd` to that directory and run `npm run clean` before everything. Then run any of  the following commands to build OfflineBay.

 - Windows (x86 & x64) - `npm run dist-win`
 - MacOS - `npm run dist-mac`
 - Linux (x64) - `npm run dist-linux-64`
 - Linux (x86) - `npm run dist-linux-32`
